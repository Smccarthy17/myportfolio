          </h2>

          <p>
              I am a self motivated entrepreneur who works well both independently and with teams.
              <br> 
              Currenly, I guide clients through the ins and outs of purchasing and selling real estate while making it as fun as possible.
              <br>
              I have degrees in Fine Art Photography and Graphic Design which I feel will enhance my developer skills.
              <br>
              I am currently attending UCONN School of Engineering's full stack developer program. When completed,
              <br>
              I will be transitioning into the wonderful world of technology.
